The United States of America (USA), also known as the United States (U.S.) or America, is a country primarily located in North America. It is a federal union of 50 states and its federal capital district of Washington, D.C. The 48 contiguous states border Canada to the north and Mexico to the south, with the semi-exclavic state of Alaska in the northwest and the archipelagic state of Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean. The U.S. also asserts sovereignty over five major island territories and various uninhabited islands.[k] It is a megadiverse country, with the world's third-largest land area[d] and third-largest population, exceeding 340 million.[l] Its three largest metropolitan areas are New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, and its three most populous states are California, Texas, and Florida.

Paleo-Indians migrated to North America across the Bering land bridge more than 12,000 years ago, and formed various civilizations and societies. Spanish exploration and colonization led to the establishment in 1513 of Spanish Florida, the first European colony in what is now the continental United States. France also began to colonize at this time, but major settlements came much later. Subsequent British colonization led to the first settlement of the Thirteen Colonies in Virginia in 1607. Intensive agriculture in the rapidly expanding Southern Colonies encouraged the forced migration of enslaved Africans. Clashes with the British Crown over taxation and political representation sparked the American Revolution, with the Second Continental Congress formally declaring independence on July 4, 1776.

The United States emerged victorious from the 1775–1783 Revolutionary War and expanded westward across North America, dispossessing Native Americans as it fought the Indian Wars and the Mexican–American War. Expansion began when the U.S. signed the 1803 Louisiana Purchase with Napoleonic France. As more states were admitted, a North–South division over slavery led to the secession of the Confederate States of America, which fought the Union in the 1861–1865 American Civil War. With the victory and preservation of the United States, slavery was abolished nationally. By the late 19th century, the United States established itself as a great power with victory in the Spanish-American War, a status solidified with its participation in World War I. Following Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the U.S. entered World War II. Its aftermath left the U.S. and the Soviet Union as the world's two superpowers and led to the Cold War, during which both countries struggled for ideological dominance and international influence. The Soviet Union's collapse and the end of the Cold War in 1991 left the U.S. as the world's sole superpower, with significant geopolitical influence globally.

The U.S. national government is a presidential constitutional federal republic and liberal democracy with three separate branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. It has a bicameral national legislature composed of the House of Representatives, a lower house based on population, and the Senate, an upper house based on equal representation for each state. The country's Democratic and Republican parties have dominated American politics since the 1850s. Federalism provides substantial autonomy to the 50 states, while American values are based on a democratic political tradition that draws its inspiration from the European Enlightenment movement.

One of the world's most developed countries, the U.S. ranks among the highest in economic competitiveness, productivity, innovation, human rights, and higher education. The United States accounted for over a quarter of nominal global economic output in 2024, and its economy has been the world's largest by nominal GDP since about 1890. It possesses by far the largest amount of wealth of any country and has the highest disposable household income per capita among OECD countries, though U.S. wealth inequality is higher than in most other developed countries. The U.S. is a member of multiple international organizations and plays a leading role in global political, cultural, economic, and military affairs.

Etymology
Further information: Names of the United States, Demonyms for the United States, United Colonies, and Naming of the Americas
The first documented use of the phrase "United States of America" is a letter from January 2, 1776. Stephen Moylan, a Continental Army aide to General George Washington, wrote to Joseph Reed, Washington's aide-de-camp, seeking to go "with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain" to seek assistance in the Revolutionary War effort.[20][21] The first known public usage is an anonymous essay published in the Williamsburg newspaper, The Virginia Gazette, on April 6, 1776.[20][22][23] By June 1776, the "United States of America" appeared in the Articles of Confederation,[24][25] and in July, the Declaration of Independence.[24] The Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776.[26]

The term "United States" and the initialism "U.S.", used as nouns or as adjectives in English, are common short names for the country. The initialism "USA", a noun, is also common.[27] "United States" and "U.S." are the established terms throughout the U.S. federal government, with prescribed rules.[m] "The States" is an established colloquial shortening of the name, used particularly from abroad;[29] "stateside" is the corresponding adjective or adverb.[30]

"America" is the feminine form of the first word of Americus Vesputius, the Latinized name of Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci (1454–1512); it was first used as a place name by the German cartographers Martin Waldseemüller and Matthias Ringmann in 1507.[31][n] Vespucci first proposed that the West Indies discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492 were part of a previously unknown landmass and not among the Indies at the eastern limit of Asia.[32][33][34] In English, the term "America" rarely refers to topics unrelated to the United States, despite the usage of "the Americas" to describe the totality of North and South America.[35]

The first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia over 12,000 years ago, either across the Bering land bridge or along the now-submerged Ice Age coastline.[37][38] The Clovis culture, which appeared around 11,000 BC, is believed to be the first widespread culture in the Americas.[39][40] Over time, indigenous North American cultures grew increasingly sophisticated, and some, such as the Mississippian culture, developed agriculture, architecture, and complex societies.[41] In the post-archaic period, the Mississippian cultures were located in the midwestern, eastern, and southern regions, and the Algonquian in the Great Lakes region and along the Eastern Seaboard, while the Hohokam culture and Ancestral Puebloans inhabited the southwest.[42] Native population estimates of what is now the United States before the arrival of European immigrants range from around 500,000[43][44] to nearly 10 million.[44][45]

Christopher Columbus began exploring the Caribbean for Spain in 1492, leading to Spanish-speaking settlements and missions from Puerto Rico and Florida to New Mexico and California. The first Spanish colony in what is now the continental United States was Spanish Florida, chartered in 1513.[46][47][48][49] After several settlements failed there due to hunger and disease, Spain's first permanent town, Saint Augustine, was founded in 1565.[50] France established its own settlements in French Florida in 1562, but they were either abandoned (Charlesfort, 1578) or destroyed by Spanish raids (Fort Caroline, 1565); permanent French settlements would be founded much later along the Great Lakes (Fort Detroit, 1701), the Mississippi River (Saint Louis, 1764) and especially the Gulf of Mexico (New Orleans, 1718).[51] Early European colonies also included the thriving Dutch colony of New Nederland (settled 1626, present-day New York) and the small Swedish colony of New Sweden (settled 1638 in what is now Delaware). British colonization of the East Coast began with the Virginia Colony (1607) and the Plymouth Colony (Massachusetts, 1620).[52][53] The Mayflower Compact in Massachusetts and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut established precedents for representative self-governance and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[54][55] While European settlers in what is now the United States experienced conflicts with Native Americans, they also engaged in trade, exchanging European tools for food and animal pelts.[56][o] Relations ranged from close cooperation to warfare and massacres. The colonial authorities often pursued policies that forced Native Americans to adopt European lifestyles, including conversion to Christianity.[60][61] Along the eastern seaboard, settlers trafficked African slaves through the Atlantic slave trade.[62]

The original Thirteen Colonies[p] that would later found the United States were administered as possessions of Great Britain,[63] and had local governments with elections open to most white male property owners.[64][65] The colonial population grew rapidly from Maine to Georgia, eclipsing Native American populations;[66] by the 1770s, the natural increase of the population was such that only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[67] The colonies' distance from Britain allowed for the development of self-governance,[68] and the First Great Awakening, a series of Christian revivals, fueled colonial interest in religious liberty.[69]

Declaration of Independence, a portrait by John Trumbull depicting the Committee of Five presenting the draft of the Declaration to the Continental Congress on June 28, 1776, in Philadelphia
Following their victory in the French and Indian War, Britain began to assert greater control over local colonial affairs, resulting in colonial political resistance; one of the primary colonial grievances was a denial of their rights as Englishmen, particularly the right to representation in the British government that taxed them. To demonstrate their dissatisfaction and resolve, the First Continental Congress met in 1774 and passed the Continental Association, a colonial boycott of British goods that proved effective. The British attempt to then disarm the colonists resulted in the 1775 Battles of Lexington and Concord, igniting the American Revolutionary War. At the Second Continental Congress, the colonies appointed George Washington commander-in-chief of the Continental Army, and created a committee that named Thomas Jefferson to draft the Declaration of Independence. Two days after passing the Lee Resolution to create an independent nation the Declaration was adopted on July 4, 1776.[70] The political values of the American Revolution included liberty, inalienable individual rights; and the sovereignty of the people;[71] supporting republicanism and rejecting monarchy, aristocracy, and all hereditary political power; civic virtue; and vilification of political corruption.[72] The Founding Fathers of the United States, who included Washington, Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, James Madison, Thomas Paine, and many others, were inspired by Greco-Roman, Renaissance, and Enlightenment philosophies and ideas.[73][74]

The Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union were ratified in 1781 and established a decentralized government that operated until 1789.[70] After the British surrender at the siege of Yorktown in 1781 American sovereignty was internationally recognized by the Treaty of Paris (1783), through which the U.S. gained territory stretching west to the Mississippi River, north to present-day Canada, and south to Spanish Florida.[75] The Northwest Ordinance (1787) established the precedent by which the country's territory would expand with the admission of new states, rather than the expansion of existing states.[76] The U.S. Constitution was drafted at the 1787 Constitutional Convention to overcome the limitations of the Articles. It went into effect in 1789, creating a federal republic governed by three separate branches that together ensured a system of checks and balances.[77] George Washington was elected the country's first president under the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights was adopted in 1791 to allay skeptics' concerns about the power of the more centralized government.[78][79] His resignation as commander-in-chief after the Revolutionary War and his later refusal to run for a third term as the country's first president established a precedent for the supremacy of civil authority in the United States and the peaceful transfer of power.[80][81]

Historical territorial expansion of the United States

Division of the states during the American Civil War:
  Union states
  Border states
  Confederate states
  Territories
The Louisiana Purchase of 1803 from France nearly doubled the territory of the United States.[82][83] Lingering issues with Britain remained, leading to the War of 1812, which was fought to a draw.[84][85] Spain ceded Florida and its Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[86] In the late 18th century, American settlers began to expand westward, many with a sense of manifest destiny.[87][88] The Missouri Compromise of 1820, which admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, attempted to balance the desire of northern states to prevent the expansion of slavery into new territories with that of southern states to extend it there. The compromise further prohibited slavery in all other lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36°30′ parallel.[89] As Americans expanded further into land inhabited by Native Americans, the federal government often applied policies of Indian removal or assimilation.[90][91] The most significant removal legislation in U.S. history was the Indian Removal Act of 1830. It culminated in the Trail of Tears (1830–1850), in which an estimated 60,000 Native Americans living east of the Mississippi River were forcibly removed and displaced to lands far to the west, resulting in anywhere from 13,200 to 16,700 deaths.[92] These and earlier organized displacements prompted a long series of American Indian Wars west of the Mississippi.[93][94] The Republic of Texas was annexed in 1845,[95] and the 1846 Oregon Treaty led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[96] Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California, Nevada, Utah, and much of present-day Colorado and the American Southwest.[87][97] The California gold rush of 1848–1849 spurred a huge migration of white settlers to the Pacific coast, leading to even more confrontations with Native populations. One of the most violent, the California genocide of thousands of Native inhabitants, lasted into the early 1870s,[98] just as additional western territories and states were created.[99]

During the colonial period, slavery had been legal in the American colonies, especially in the agriculture-intensive Southern Colonies from Maryland to Georgia. The practice began to be significantly questioned during the American Revolution.[100] Spurred by an active abolitionist movement that had reemerged in the 1830s, states in the North enacted anti-slavery laws.[101] At the same time, support for slavery had strengthened in Southern states with inventions such as the cotton gin (1793), which had long made the institution profitable for Southern elites.[102][103][104] Throughout the 1850s, this sectional conflict regarding slavery was further inflamed by legislation in Congress and decisions of the Supreme Court: The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 mandated the return of slaves taking refuge in non-slave states to their owners in the South. The Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854 effectively gutted the anti-slavery requirements of the Missouri Compromise.[105] Finally, in its Dred Scott decision of 1857, the Supreme Court ruled against a slave brought into non-slave territory and declared the Missouri Compromise to be unconstitutional. These events exacerbated tensions between North and South that would culminate in the American Civil War (1861–1865).[106][107] Eleven slave states seceded and formed the Confederate States of America, while the other states remained in the Union.[108][109] War broke out in April 1861 after the Confederates bombarded Fort Sumter.[110][111] After the January 1863 Emancipation Proclamation, many freed slaves joined the Union army.[112] The war began to turn in the Union's favor following the 1863 Siege of Vicksburg and Battle of Gettysburg, and the Confederacy surrendered in 1865 after the Union's victory in the Battle of Appomattox Court House.[113] The Reconstruction era followed the war. After the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, Reconstruction Amendments were passed to protect the rights of African Americans. National infrastructure, including transcontinental telegraph and railroads, spurred growth in the American frontier.[114]

An Edison Studios film showing immigrants arriving at Ellis Island in New York Harbor, a major point of entry for European immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries[115][116]
From 1865 through 1917, an unprecedented stream of immigrants arrived in the United States, including 24.4 million from Europe.[117] Most came through the port of New York City, and New York City and other large cities on the East Coast became home to large Jewish, Irish, and Italian populations, while many Germans and Central Europeans moved to the Midwest. At the same time, about one million French Canadians migrated from Quebec to New England.[118] During the Great Migration, millions of African Americans left the rural South for urban areas in the North.[119] Alaska was purchased from Russia in 1867.[120]

The Compromise of 1877 effectively ended Reconstruction and white supremacists took local control of Southern politics.[121][122] African Americans endured a period of heightened, overt racism following Reconstruction, a time often called the nadir of American race relations.[123][124] A series of Supreme Court decisions, including Plessy v. Ferguson, emptied the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments of their force, allowing Jim Crow laws in the South to remain unchecked, sundown towns in the Midwest, and segregation in communities across the country, which would be reinforced by the policy of redlining later adopted by the federal Home Owners' Loan Corporation.[125]
